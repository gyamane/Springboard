# An Exploration of Housing Sales in Washington D.C. and King County

Moving can be a major hurdle for one's life. Whether it is the first time moving out on your own after graduating from college or if you are beginning to start a family and looking to settle down, buying one's own place can be quite expensive. Knowing the housing market and what to expect if you are moving to an unfamiliar place can be a challenging task. But what if there was a way to model housing trends and predict what you may have to pay? One model cannot accurately summarize every housing market, but being able to take two geographically separate locations and compare how house features are weighted differently when building housing price models can prove beneficial to both real estate agents and their clients when deciding where to move and what to buy. The goal of this project is to build individual accurate predictive machine learning model for both Washington D.C. and King County in order to both closely examine what features heavily impact the price of a house sale and to help prospective buyers understand the market they are buying into.
