# San Francisco Crime Data Analysis and  2003-2019
San Francisco crime and safety are concerns for visitors and residents alike. These concerns highlight the importance of staying educated 
regarding police reports that have occurred in the past. Are certain areas more dangerous than others? What times of the day do more crimes tend to occur, and do additional factors such as the time of the year (Christmas, Black Friday, etc.) influence the risk of crime These types of questions help people in San Francisco keep safe and aware of the potential dangers that could pose a direct threat to them. Through observing past crime data and police reports, I illustrated key features and suggested patterns that contribute to conditions leading to crime in San Francisco. In the following files, I used my findings to model San Francisco crime data in order to decipher important factors that contribute to San Francisco crime patterns. The City of San Francisco could use this to better prepare for certain events when crime rates tend to spike and take appropriate precautionary measures to target areas that are unsafe to keep visitors and residents protected from harm.
